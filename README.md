# Calculator
This is a simple Calculator with GUI. Its programmed with python and tkinter.
The project is first of all ready, but i'm working on being able to continue calculating with the result and into it to include fraction numbers. That means you can use
it now like an usual calculator but im still into adding new things. There are'nt any errors now but im still looking for any bugs to fix.

You will find the code in the Calculator folder. Just launch the calculator.py file.

You dont need much to launch it. Just an output engine like Python or Visual Studio Code (or simliar). If you arleady have one of these, your'e be able to start it.

You're allowed to use this project commercially but you have to leave a copyright notice of me. If you are using this private, there's no problem.

Enjoy my first tkinter project. And please leave me Feedback. Thank you!
